# Welcome to the sandpiper SDK

## Installation
For normal operation it is sufficient to clone this repo and place it in any convenient location.

The linux setup on sandpiper already contains the gcc compilers, git, and nano editor therefore getting started should be as easy as compiling one of the samples provided and running it.

Please check out the samples/ directory to learn how certain hardware components work.
